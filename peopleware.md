## The right people

### Leadership
The best leadership is often exercised by people without positional power. Leadership is not about extracting anything from others, it's about service, it's about enabling others to get magic to happen.
In order to lead without positional authority you have to:
* step up to the task
* be evidently fit for the task
* prepare for the task ahead of time
* maximize value to everyone
* do it with humour and goodwill
* have charisma

# Hiring
The authors question the efficiency of aptitude tests for developers, as many of them might after a few years end up doing completely different work. In my experience at Klarna, most of the employees hired as developers are still working as developers. I do think that during the hiring process one should assess the candidate technical skills and its ability to learn. The book doesn't talk about how you would do that though.

The authors also say that, since our is business is, at least, as sociological as it is technological, the hiring process should focus more than it does today on sociological and humman communication traits. The main idea that they present is to ask the candidate to perform an "audition" where she would present for 10-15 minutes something work related: an interesting project she worked on, a technology she just learned which she finds exciting, a lesson learnt. The future co-workers of this hire should be part of the audience and should be part of the decision process. I can see some good points in this strategy, but I can imagine how some candidates would feel a bit or very uncomfortable with this test.
