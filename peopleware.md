## The right people

### Leadership
The best leadership is often exercised by people without positional power. Leadership is not about extracting anything from others, it's about service, it's about enabling others to get magic to happen.
In order to lead without positional authority you have to:
* step up to the task
* be evidently fit for the task
* prepare for the task ahead of time
* maximize value to everyone
* do it with humour and goodwill
* have charisma

### Hiring
The authors question the efficiency of aptitude tests for developers, as many of them might after a few years end up doing completely different work. In my experience at Klarna, most of the employees hired as developers are still working as developers. I do think that during the hiring process one should assess the candidate technical skills and its ability to learn. The book doesn't talk about how you would do that though.

The authors also say that, since our is business is, at least, as sociological as it is technological, the hiring process should focus more than it does today on sociological and humman communication traits. The main idea that they present is to ask the candidate to perform an "audition" where she would present for 10-15 minutes something work related: an interesting project she worked on, a technology she just learned which she finds exciting, a lesson learnt. The future co-workers of this hire should be part of the audience and should be part of the decision process. I can see some good points in this strategy, but I can imagine how some candidates would feel a bit or very uncomfortable with this test.

### Why people leave a company
For organizations with a turnover above 30 percent, a few reasons to quit are:
* a just-passing-through mentality. Developers have no feelings of long-term involvement.
* a feeling that management thinks of workers as interchangeable parts.

Turnover engenders turnover.

My opinion:
>Within big companies (>300 employees), developers mostly quit because they feel stuck, bored, unchallenged and lack learning. After about 1-2 years of having worked on the same project, and given that the engineer performs a very reduced set of tasks, the engineer will get bored and unchallenged, no matter what.

>If a company would really like to keep an engineer, it should, every 4-6 months, actively approach the engineer and ask about his/her levels of motivation, challenges and learning. If such levels are going down, encourage the engineer to change to a team or a project where there is as much new stuff for him/her as possible: tech stack, tools, responsibilities, team members, product, location. Only in this way you will have a chance of keeping a valuable engineer around for a longer period of time.

>It also helps if the type of tasks an engineer is performing are as wide as possible: just coding business logic vs doing all sorts of stuff (coding, testing, platform, db, devops, tools).


>Lack of high-quality communication is another reason why developers quit. It might very well be that management cares about the engineers and does not think of them as interchangeable parts. But that is completely irrelevant if the actions performed by management can easily be interpreted as them not caring so much about them.

>As a CIO / CTO, you will only have engineers who are motivated, involved with the company's vision, loyal and committed if you and all the other managers are 100% transparent to them. There is no other way long term. Let them know:
* what management is up to
* what management is concerned with
* what major changes might happen in the future (and have them involved in the discussion! From senior to junior engineers, from team A to team Z, do involve them)

>As a CIO / CTO, make sure that not only you do that, but also all managers do so.
